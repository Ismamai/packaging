What is this?
-------------

Packaging for debian (ubuntu really). Check out `build.sh` to see how we are now packing valhalla into its library, devel and bin packages. It also has links and notes about how to get those packages onto your PPA. Enjoy and thanks!

What should I do?
-----------------

This was based off of the `prime_server` [packaging work](https://github.com/kevinkreiser/ppa-libprime-server) so your best bet is to head over there to see if that has relevant examples to get you up and running.
